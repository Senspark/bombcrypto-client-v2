    - desc: Participate in BombCrypto's online community to stay updated with the
        latest news and engage in discussions
    - desc: BHero is a collection of NFT heroes with unique stats and rarities. They
        can be infinitely minted or traded and are used for mining reward tokens
        and other in-game features.
    - desc: 'Each BHero is minted with randomized attributes and skills, determining
        their mining power, speed, stamina, bomb capacity, and bomb range. '
    - desc: In Treasure Hunt mode, BHeroes prioritize blocks with higher health points.
        If a block already has a bomb, heroes move to the next target.
    - desc: 'There are two types of heroes: HERO-FI for Treasure Hunt Mode and HERO-TR
        for Adventure and PvP Modes.'
    - desc: Legacy Heroes (Hero L) are original heroes without shields, identifiable
        by an "L" icon on their card.
    - desc: Upgrade a Hero L to a Hero S by staking BCOIN for 30 days, which grants
        them a shield.
    - desc: Hero S comes with a shield that provides extra protection during battles
        and mining.
    - desc: Obtain Hero S by minting in the Shop or buying them directly from the
        marketplace.
    - desc: Hero S can also be obtained by rescuing them from Prison Chests in the
        game.
    - desc: Shield Durability points indicate how long a shield will last. BHeroes
        with higher rarity have shields with greater durability, allowing them to
        withstand more damage.
    - desc: Use Quartz to repair damaged shields. The amount of Quartz needed depends
        on the BHero's rarity and the Shield's level.
    - desc: A Hero S without a shield is more vulnerable to damage, making shield
        maintenance crucial for protection.
    - desc: Prioritize repairing shields for higher rarity heroes first, as they
        require more Quartz and offer greater benefits in gameplay.
    - desc: You can obtain Quartz by purchasing it in the shop using BCOIN, or by
        burning BHeroes in the Exchange section.
    - desc: Higher rarity heroes and higher-level shields require more Quartz for
        repairs, but they also absorb more damage.
    - desc: Balance your use of BCOIN to buy Quartz and consider burning less useful
        Bheroes to obtain additional Quartz.
    - desc: 'Fusion: Successfully fused Bheroes receive randomly generated attributes
        to newly minted heroes.'
    - desc: Increase your fusion success rate by using lower-rarity heroes as support
        ingredients. The percentage increase is calculated based on the rarity difference.
    - desc: If fusion fails, all materials are lost, so carefully consider your ingredients
        and support ingredient.
    - desc: Activate up to 15 Bheroes for mining activities. Unactivated Bheroes
        do not recover energy, so manage your active roster strategically.
    - desc: The Inventory can hold up to 500 Bheroes, providing ample space to collect
        and manage a diverse roster.
    - desc: Invest in higher-tier BHouses to reduce your Bheroes' rest time, allowing
        them to spend more time mining for rewards.
    - desc: In Treasure Hunt Mode, BHeroes plant bombs automatically, allowing players
        to save time and focus on other tasks.
    - desc: BHouses significantly boost BHeroes' energy recovery rates, enhancing
        their efficiency in mining activities.
    - desc: Heroes S without the minimum staking amount won't receive BCOIN or SEN,
        but they can still earn Star Cores.
    - desc: With Ranking Rewards, the more you stake on your BHeroes, the higher
        their ranking within their pool, leading to greater rewards.
    - desc: Ranking Rewards are distributed fairly across different rarity levels,
        with higher rewards going to heroes with the most stake within the same rarity.
    - desc: 'Daily Pool Refills: All six reward pools are replenished with BCOIN
        and SEN every 24 hours, ensuring continuous opportunities for players to
        earn rewards.'
    - desc: 'Pool Exhaustion and Reset: If all reward pools are depleted before 24
        hours, the system halts reward distribution until the next refill to maintain
        balance.'
    - desc: Activate Auto Mine to let your BHeroes automatically resume mining when
        they reach 70% energy, saving you time and effort.
    - desc: Heroes with higher rarity or stats are prioritized for Home placement
        to recharge faster, optimizing mining efficiency.
    - desc: "If you\u2019re logged in and Auto Mine is enabled, the game will automatically
        reconnect if you experience a disconnection, ensuring uninterrupted mining."
    - desc: The Prison Chest is a special chest that allows you to rescue BHeroes
        instead of providing BCOIN or SEN. Prison chests appear randomly on some
        maps.
    - desc: In a 1vs1 match, at each 30-second mark, hard blocks fall from the top,
        shrinking the play area. Heroes need to avoid these areas before the hard
        blocks fall if they don't want to lose the match.
    - desc: Join the Bomb Crypto tournament to network with other players and learn
        from their techniques
    - desc: Before withdrawing, review your available balance and consider the associated
        fees to optimize your asset management.
    - desc: Base Reward is the primary reward granted for successfully breaking Block
        Chests in Bomb Crypto, including BCOIN, SEN, and Star Core. You need to stake
        BHeroes to be eligible for Base Rewards.
